# PySH
PySH, a PowerShell-like shell built on Python.

Similar to PwSH, PySH has better type syntax than PowerShell. It's more easier to understand PySH than PWSH.

PySH is work in progress. I would enjoy it if you would add more commands, fix bugs, etc.

**I do not offer any warranty for PySH. Use it at your own risk.**
