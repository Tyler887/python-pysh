# PySH
PySH, a PowerShell-like shell built on Python.

Similar to PWSH, PySH has better type syntax than PowerShell. It's more easier to understand PySH than PWSH.

PySH is work in progress. I would enjoy it if you would add more commands, fix bugs, etc.

**I do not offer any warranty for PySH. Use it at your own risk.**
## Run
### Interpreter
[Download PySH](https://github.com/tyler887/python-pysh/releases) if you havent and open the `shell.py`.
### IDLE
Download PySH if you havent, open the IDLE Shell, open the `shell.py`, and run it.

Note that some commands like `cls` will not work since unlike using the interpreter, they open in the system terminal (Windows 11 terminal or something like that) and not the IDLE Shell.
## Q&A
### Is PySH free for commercial use? In addition, can I make modified versions?
For both, yes. PyShell is completely free of charge, and you may modify it or commercially use it.
